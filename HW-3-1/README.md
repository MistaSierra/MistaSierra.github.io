I think im finally getting the hang of this, there are a few things i dont know how to fix. Like I tried code a moving rectangle
and its not showing up on the website even though p5 says theres nothing wrong with it. And my sketch is supposed to refresh your drawings everytime you click and it works with the p5 preview but not on the actual web.
