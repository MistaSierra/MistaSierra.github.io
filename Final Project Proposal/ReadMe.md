I think my project is going to be very similar to that app game, Slither.io, except much, much simpler. I was think a static character would
would follow wherever your mouse is as you try to avoid the color coordinated bouncing ball-like characters that would periodically spawn.
If you bumped into one smaller than you you would increase in size and if you bumped into one larger than you, you would decrease in size.
There would be a timer counting down and when it stops your current size would be your score. It would be  cool to record your high scores
but I don't really know how I would achieve that.

I was thinking, perhaps maybe by next week I would have the characters sketched out and bouncing and following my mouse. And then around
the next week I would try to make them aware of each
other and then maybe also have the increase/decrease size down. And then finally I would insert
the timer and possibly the scoreboard if I have time.

I think it would be cool to also add some kind of 8 bit music that speeds up as the timer gets closer to
