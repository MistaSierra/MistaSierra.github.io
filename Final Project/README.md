For this sketch I wanted to create a Slither.io like game where you avoid "creatures" larger than you and defeat ones smaller than yourself. You defeat them when you run into them, you become larger than yourself. Kind of like you ate them. If you are defeated by ones larger than yourself you get a "chunk taken out of you". The sound aspect of it would add pressure to the player and make them feel like the stakes are higher than they actually are. If i'd had the time and skill, i would have added a score board. This would have made it more interesting for the player because then it'd be like they we're competing with themself and it would make them want to play the game.
